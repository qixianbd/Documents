In the next 7 months, I will:

1. Do the things that can make me special, that can defined me, can make me crazy in it. 

2. Take more patience to do the subtle things, do the subtle things well, do the writing well. 

3. Take more time to do physical practice, running or something else. 

4. Code the code that I want to see what it will be; code the code that I used to want to code but haven't done yet; code the code that I think it's interesting; code the code and collect the code, and improve my own code. 

5. To be good at clear up all the things, including the bedroom or dormitory room, the office desk, the document and code in my computer and network. 

6. To be good at explain my idea, my mind. Make the communications be more easier. 

7. Reading many many books, and be a knowledge man. 

8. Be a working-hard man. 

9. Do the things that define you, and do the things that you want to do in your mind. Be a action giant, not only the thinking giant. 

10. Action is the key. Just try, just take actions.
