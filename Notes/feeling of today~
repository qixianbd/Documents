	Today, I feel myself not feeling very well. I found myself having forgotten many things. 

	I should focus my energy on some main point, not all the aspects. Typing the word with a good speed perhaps is a good thing, 
and it's really worthy us to pursue it. 

	The most important part in our life is the choice making. Making a right choice is really means walking towards a correct direction. That means the further endeavor can be worthy. 

 	I want to make myself to be a good writer. I mean, I should make myself to be person who really loving spending time on writing. When you spend more time on writing, then you will know that, you should explain the matters as simple as you can. 

	Make the matters to be simple and clear. 
	Make a clearly conclusion, make a slow conclusion, not a urgent and full-mistake one. 

	Do your best endeavor to do something you really love, you really care and the one that can really make you crazy. 

	I have already been 25 years old, (ie, tomorrow will be 26). I found myself haven't do something crazy, or something special, or something that really defined me, and make me different. I do think this is a great failure. 

	I want to  try more. I want to find myself, and do something that really reflect my hearts, and something that I think can define me. 

	In the future, I want to be the person like this:

	(1)Be very professional on my specific areas. Having a very tough knowledge, and be a really rigorous man. 

	(2)Caring the subtle point, and paying more attention to make the work perfect. 

	(3)Be a man that love trying, love knowledge, and having knowledge.
